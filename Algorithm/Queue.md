# Queue

## 1. Queue Structure

- FIFO (First In First Out) or LILO (Last In Last Out) where data that enters first comes out first
- Input and output directions are each fixed, with data input occurring at the end of the queue and data output occurring at the front of the queue

<br/>

## 2. Queue Characteristics

- **FIFO (First In First Out)**: First in, first out
- **Two input/output directions**
- Data can be added and removed **one at a time**

<br/>

## 3. Real-world Queue Examples

- Printing multiple documents in order from a printer connected to a computer
- Using Queue as a data structure for temporary memory storage to overcome speed and time differences (=buffer)
