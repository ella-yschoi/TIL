# Web Application Architecture

## 1. Client-Server Architecture

- Separating where resources like product information exist and apps that use resources is called 2-tier architecture
- Client: App that uses resources
- Server: Place that provides resources

<br/>

## 2. Characteristics of Client and Server

- Client and server have a request-response relationship
- In client-server architecture, request comes first, then response follows
- Server only plays the role of delivering resources
- Space where resources are stored is called database, and form with added DB is called 3-tier architecture

<br/>

## 3. Types of Client and Server

- Clients are distinguished by platform:
  - Client in web platform mainly used through browser: website or web app
  - Apps like iOS, Android can also be clients
- Servers differ by what they do (mail server, file server, web server, etc.)

<br/>

## 4. Client-Server Communication and API

- In web application architecture, client and server communicate using HTTP protocol
- At this time, server provides interface for clients to utilize resources well, which is called API (Application Programming *Interface) (*Interface: contact point made for communication to be possible)
- API documentation must be written for clients to utilize it
