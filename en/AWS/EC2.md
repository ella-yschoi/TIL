## What Can You Do with EC2?

- The most basic thing you can do through EC2 is **installing a web server** and **providing services that users request through web browsers**
- An instance is a unit that means one computer, and **renting a computer from AWS is called creating an instance**
- Creating an AWS EC2 instance means renting a computer configured with operating system, CPU, RAM, or runtime based on AMI

## Benefits of Using EC2

- Short time required for configuration (better than buying a PC and setting it up)
- Through AMI (Amazon Machine Image: template with software configuration), you can choose various operating systems according to your needs
  - EC2 provides various templates called AMI, making it easy to select and configure operating systems as needed
  - Not only operating systems but also CPU, RAM, and capacity can be easily configured
