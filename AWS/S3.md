# S3

## What is S3?

> Simple Storage Service: Cloud storage service provided by AWS

<br/>

## Benefits of Using S3

### (1) Scalability

- Can expand/contract storage scale without spending much time and effort
- Storage capacity can be **infinitely expanded**, and you only pay for what you use, making it very cost-effective

### (2) Strong Durability

- Higher storage durability means lower possibility of losing stored files
- S3 guarantees 99.999999999% durability

### (3) 99.99% Availability Guarantee

- Higher availability means longer time to normally use files stored in storage
- S3 is designed to guarantee 99.99% annual storage availability

### (4) Various Storage Classes

- Different storage classes can be efficiently selected depending on the purpose of using the storage
- Two storage classes that S3 users typically choose most
  - **S3 Standard**
    - Good for general purpose use
    - Advantages: Fast access to data, fast processing speed for data access requests
    - Disadvantages: High data storage costs, so not an efficient choice for long-term data storage purposes
  - **S3 Glacier**
    - Good when using storage for long-term storage purposes
    - Advantages: Very low cost for storing data
    - Disadvantages: Slow speed for accessing stored data

### (5) Static Website Hosting Available

- S3 **provides buckets as space where users can deploy static websites**. Upload static files to a storage space called a bucket and configure the bucket for static website hosting to deploy static websites
- **Static Files**
  - Refers to **files created without server intervention**
  - Conversely, when a client sends a request to the server, files created on the spot by the server according to the request are called 'dynamic files'
- **Web Hosting**
  - Service that rents out a space on a server
- **Bucket**
  - A basket that contains files stored in S3. Also called the **top-level directory for storing files**
  - All files stored in S3 must be stored inside a bucket, and **unlimited amounts of files can be stored in a bucket**
  - Each bucket has a name, and **the bucket name must be unique in the region where the bucket belongs**
  - Also, bucket policies can be created to **modify other users' access permissions** for that bucket
- **Object**
  - Files contained in buckets are called 'objects' in S3. This is because S3 stores data in key-value pair format when storing data in storage
  - Objects stored in S3 consist of files and metadata
    - File: **Actual data is stored** in the file's value, and the maximum size of data that can be stored as an S3 object value is 5TB
    - File key: Serves as an **identifier that makes each object unique**. Desired objects can be searched using the file key
    - Metadata is data containing information about the object such as creation date, size, and type, and is **data that describes the object**
    - All objects have unique URL addresses, and the URL address is in the form of `http://[bucket name].S3.amazonaws.com/[object key]`, and desired data can also be accessed through the URL address
